**MNISTED - Not tested (ml, stego)**
------------------------------------

### **Description:**

>   We trained the model especially for you, but the deadline was jamming us in
>   the corner - so we didn't have time to check ... BUT! Don't worry, we'll
>   send you the test data ... P.S.: mean, std = [0.1307, 0.3081]

>   *model*: `torch.save(anal_model.state(dict),
>   “models/anal-model-jit-script.pth”)`

>   data: `hot_milfs/MNIST_test_data.zip` \<-- (click to download, stupid)

### **Hints:**

>   just check the model... and see which pictures is wrong... That's how tests
>   do, isn't it?;

>   see metadata of these pictures;
